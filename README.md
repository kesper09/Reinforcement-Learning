<h1><b> Working and understanding of Stable Baselines 3</b></h1>
<br> <br> 
<label for="Explain>This is the basic working of the code so far</label>
<list id = "Explain">
<ul>Train the model without rendering</ul>
<ul>Render the testing that takes place after the model is trained and save it as a video in a directory</ul>
</list>
<br>
<h3>The following is a demo from a test video</h3>

<h1> Training a model </h1>
<p>The code for training the reinforcment learning model you would have to run the mod_logging.py file<br></p>

<p>You would be prompted to fill in the inputs as seen above</p><br><br>
<p> You could test the trained model in the mod_test.py and save the result>

<label for="Updates">Expected Updates in the Project</label>
<list id = "Updates">
<ul>Writing a code to train in custom environments</ul>
<ul>Creating a docker image for the environment</ul>

<p>The videos by sentdex have been instrumental in understanding the implementing the basics of stable baselines 3 and I would<br>strongly recommend watching them as you are going through the code.</p> <br>
